### Network Security Monitoring Basics

**Network security monitoring** is essential for protecting networks from unauthorized access, misuse, or theft. It involves continuously observing network traffic to detect anomalies and potential threats. 

#### Key Concepts/Terminology

- **Packets**: These are small units of data transmitted over a network. It usually contains a Header and Payload. Monitoring packets helps identify unusual patterns that may indicate a security threat.
- **Protocols**: These are rules that govern data transmission over networks. Common protocols include 
    - HTTP: used for Web traffic, 
    - HTTPS: for a secured web traffic 
    - FTP: For file transfer 
    - TCP/IP: For connection-oriented and reliable transmission of data.
- **Firewalls**: These are security devices that monitor and control incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. They act as a barrier between trusted and untrusted networks.
- **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)**: These are tools that monitor network traffic for suspicious activity and known threats. IDS can be network-based (NIDS) or host-based (HIDS).

#### Monitoring Network Traffic

Network security monitoring involves several techniques to detect anomalies:

- **Deep Packet Inspection (DPI)**: This involves analyzing the content of data packets to identify malicious activity.
- **Anomaly Detection**: This process helps to establishes a baseline of normal network behavior and identifies deviations from this baseline.
- **Signature-Based Detection**: This involves using  known patterns of malicious activity to identify threats.
- **Behavioral Analysis**: This process helps to monitors user and network behavior to detect unusual activities that may indicate a security breach.

#### Key Monitoring Points

- Entry/Exit points
- Critical server segments
- User network segments
- Demilitarized zone (DMZ)


#### Importance of Network Security Monitoring

Network security monitoring is essential for:

- **Visibility**: Gaining insights into network activity to identify and respond to threats quickly.
- **Threat Detection**: Identifying and mitigating security threats before they cause significant damage.
- **Compliance**: Ensuring adherence to regulatory requirements and industry standards.
