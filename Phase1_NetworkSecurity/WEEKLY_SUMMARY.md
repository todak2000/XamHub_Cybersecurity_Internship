### 2: Challenges
- I had issues seting up localized network permissble to my VMs where each VM can talk to the other on same network. This was due to lack of knowledge on how to set it up. I had to do my research on how to setup VMs on same network where i got a website where i can select prepared Vulnerable VMs - https://www.vulnhub.com. I also leveraged on Youtube videos (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gcw2MX44REI) to understand some setup especially around DHCP configuration of th VirtualBox.
